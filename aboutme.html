        <p>I like the Director James Cameron works,and the way he displays the lush alien world of Pandora live the Na'vi, 
            beings who appear primitive but are highly evolved. 
            Because the planet's environment is poisonous, human/Na'vi hybrids, 
            called Avatars, must link to human minds to allow for free movement on Pandora.
            Jake Sully, a paralyzed former Marine, becomes mobile again through one such Avatar and 
            falls in love with a Na'vi woman (Zoe Saldana). As a bond with her grows, 
            he is drawn into a battle for the survival of her world.</p>
